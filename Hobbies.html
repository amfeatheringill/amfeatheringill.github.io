<li>♦ Video Games<br>I've been gaming my whole life, I spent many years playing Smash Bros professionally in my younger years going to tournaments across the country, and now enjoy many other games more casually.</li><br>
<li>♦ Exercise<br>I've been passionate about exercise for the last couple of years, I do a lot of cardio and strength training with my home gym.</li><br>
<li>♦ Swimming<br>I have been swimming my whole life and I sadly do not do it as much as I used to since I don't have easy access to a pool anymore. But every time I get to get in the pool I have a blast!</li><br>
<li>♦ Rock Climbing<br>I just started doing this again recently after taking a break for a couple of years but I love it! I am still not very good, my highest course I've successfully climbed at the Triangle Rock Club is a 5.8</li><br>
<li>♦ Hiking<br>Hiking is more of a casual enjoyment of mine but I have hiked a trail on Mt. Fuji in Japan as well as very many local trails in NC.</li> <br>
